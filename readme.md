# PHP TRAINING EXCERCISE FROM CODEWARS

## PHP-ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

*** In this kata, your task is to implement an extended version of the famous rock-paper-scissors game. The rules are as follows: ***

Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
Rock crushes Scissors

*** Task: ***
Given two values from the above game, return the Player result as "Player 1 Won!", "Player 2 Won!", or "Draw!".

*** Inputs ***
Values will be given as one of "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", "spock".

## PHP-AVG-SPEED

*** Speed is a crucial measure of success for any aspiring warrior, so let's write a function to calculate it. ***

Average Speed is calculated by dividing distance by time. Given two strings as input the first of which indicates a codewarrior's distance travelled (in metres or kilometres) and the second indicating the time it takes them to travel (in seconds or minutes), return a string indicating their speed in miles per hour rounded to the nearest integer.

For the purposes of this kata one metre per second is defined as 2.23694 miles per hour.

So for example given the input values of distance & time "3km" and "5min" we should return a speed value of "22mph".
